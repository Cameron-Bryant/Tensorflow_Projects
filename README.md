In the Simple CovNet notebook, I was wanting to learn about convolutional neural networks.
I tend to learn better if I go into a topic with the mindset of 'How would I explain this to another person'.
So I used that mindset to create that noteboook, and I feel that I gained a better grasp on the topic than if I had only did the model.

Also it made me learn more about how to create detailed jupyter notebooks/google colab files.
